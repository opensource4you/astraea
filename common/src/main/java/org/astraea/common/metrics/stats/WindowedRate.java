/**
 * Ratio of increased/decreased value and past value. This statistic records the all the values and
 * clear the out-dated values at the same time. Every time {@link #measure()} is called, it will
 * clear the out-dated values and return the increasing rate. The increasing rate is calculated by
 * (latest-oldest)/oldest. As a result, the returned value may be negative. Depend on the value
 * increasing or decreasing. For example, if we have a windowed-rate with time interval 2.

 * <p>At time 0, At time 1, we record the value +10. At the same time, if we measure this
 * windowed-rate, we will get positive infinite. Because the initial value is 0.0, which is the
 * result of divided by zero in floating point calculation. At time 2, we record the value +5. We
 * get positive infinite when measuring because the value at time 0 is 0.0. At time 3, the {@link
 * #measure()} returns 0.5. Because the value at time 1 is 10, and the value increased +5 between
 * time 1 and time 3. At time 4, we record the value -5. Then we will measure -0.33. A negative
 * ratio means the value decrease. At time 5, it is the same as time 4. At time 6, the out-dated
 * value is cleared. The measurement becomes 0.0. Meaning that the value do not change in the time
 * interval.
