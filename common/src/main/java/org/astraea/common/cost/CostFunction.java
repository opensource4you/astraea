/**
 * It is meaningless to implement this interface. Instead, we should implement interfaces like
 * {@link HasBrokerCost} ,{@link HasClusterCost}.
 *
 * <p>Constructors in CostFunction can only take no or only one parameter {@link Configuration}, ex.
 * Constructor({@link Configuration} configuration) or Constructor()
 *
 * <p>A cost function might take advantage of some Mbean metrics to function. One can indicate such
 * requirement in the {@link CostFunction#metricSensor()} function. If the operation logic of
 * CostFunction thinks the metrics on hand are insufficient or not ready to work. One can throw a
 * {@link NoSufficientMetricsException} from the calculation logic of {@link HasBrokerCost} or
 * {@link HasClusterCost}. This serves as a hint to the caller that it needs newer metrics and
 * please retry later.
 *
 * <p>Also, it is recommended to override {@link Object#toString()} to provide the descriptive text
 * along the cost function instance. This information might be shown on some user interfaces.
