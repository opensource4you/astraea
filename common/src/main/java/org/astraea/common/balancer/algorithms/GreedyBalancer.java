  /**
   * The maximum alteration to a ClusterInfo in one cluster state exploration trial.
   *
   * <p>GreedyBalancer tries to discover a better way to allocate logs, by altering the given
   * current log allocation. This config controls the maximum number of alteration in one go. The
   * larger the number the bolder move it can be made in one go. But it doesn't mean the larger this
   * config the better. On The Contrary, less move usually helps approach good allocation. There are
   * a few things to consider when tuning this number:
   *
   * <h3>Large max step</h3>
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>(Good)Make it possible to jump out of a local minimum.
   *   <li>(Bad)The expected score improvement of each alteration is negative most of the time.
   *       Making more moves usually results in the worst state. All these large steps might be a
   *       waste of calculation
   * </ol>
   *
   * <h3>Small max step</h3>
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>(Good)Less step equals to less calculation, this can save some considerable processing
   *       resource for balancer to focus on explore the state space
   *   <li>(Good)You can construct a good large move with many small moves, with more confident.
   *   <li>(Good)The Kafka log allocation optimization problem usually come with very high
   *       dimensions. When the dimension is high, we have more chances to slip to a better state.
   *       So we probably won't be stuck at a pretty bad local minimum.
   *   <li>(Bad)When we really stuck at bad local minimum, we won't be able to jump out of it.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <h3>Other discussion</h3>
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>The mindset behind greedy balancer is discovering better allocation by making many steps
   *       of move. Not making large move in one go.
   *   <li>Larger move usually results in a terrible cluster state. Although this depends on the
   *       implementation of the allocation tweaker, the allocation tweaker we are using now making
   *       move blinding in the state space. So it might not propose a good move, especially when
   *       more moves have been made the chance of getting a terrible state is higher. Due to this
   *       reason making more moves might make it hard for GreedyBalancer to discover a good plan.
   *   <li>Making many alterations in one go can helps to escape the local minimum. But in the
   *       allocation problem we are facing right now, it is probably hard to get stuck in a bad
   *       local minimum. (Warning, the following thought is totally based on my heuristic and a few
   *       discussion on the Internet. I didn't prove this formally) The local minimum we see one
   *       book is usually depict in two or three dimension space. With such low number of
   *       dimension, it is hard to escape a local minimum since we have fewer dimension to choice
   *       to. But when the dimension getting higher, there is more chance a state can slip out to
   *       somewhere better since there is more choice to made. So it is hard to get stuck in a bad
   *       local minimum when the dimension is higher. We probably don't need to worry about
   *       escaping local minimum when solving the Kafka log allocation problem. The Kafka partition
   *       allocation problem has a feature, it usually have a very high dimension. By dimension I
   *       mean the thing can be tune, for each partition you can consider it as a dimension. So if
   *       a cluster has 5000 partitions, there are 5000 knobs (dimension) that can be tune.
