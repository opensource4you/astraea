   * Given a {@link ClusterLogAllocation}, tweak it by certain implementation specific logic.

   * <p>In a nutshell. This function takes a {@link ClusterLogAllocation} and return another
   * modified version of the given {@link ClusterLogAllocation}. The caller can use this method for
   * browsing the space of possible {@link ClusterLogAllocation}.
   *
   * <p>If the implementation find no alternative feasible {@link ClusterLogAllocation}. Then an
   * empty {@link Stream} will be returned. We don't encourage the implementation to return the
   * original {@link ClusterLogAllocation} as part of the Stream result. Since there is no tweaking
   * occurred.
   *
   * @param brokerFolders key is the broker id, and the value is the folder used to keep data
   * @param baseAllocation the {@link ClusterLogAllocation} as the base being tweaked.
   * @return a {@link Stream} of possible tweaked {@link ClusterLogAllocation}.
