# Quickstart

There are two scripts which can setup env quickly by container

## Set up zookeeper env

```shell
./docker/start_zk.sh
```

The above script creates a zookeeper instance by container. Also, it will show the command used to add broker instance. For example:

```shell
=================================================
run ./docker/start_broker.sh zookeeper.connect=192.168.50.178:17228 to join kafka broker
=================================================
```

## Set up (kafka) broker env

After the zk env is running, you can copy the command (see above example) from zk script output to setup kafka. For example:
```shell
./docker/start_broker.sh zookeeper.connect=192.168.50.178:17228
```

The console will show the broker connection information and JMX address. For example:

```shell
=================================================
broker address: 192.168.50.224:11248
jmx address: 192.168.50.224:15905
=================================================
```

Noted that the command to set up broker can be executed multiple times to create a broker cluster.
